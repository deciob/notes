= CSS Units =

== Numbers ==

{{{css
  /* This number refers to a ration of the font-size. */
  line-length: 1.5
}}}


== Percentages ==

{{{css
  /* This percentage refers to the parent's width. */
  width: 50%;
  
  /* This percentage refers to the element's width. */
  transform: translateX(10%);
}}}


= Dimensions =

If you add a unit to a number, we have dimensions!

We can have absolute units (cm, px, etc.) and relative units (ch, rem, em, etc.).
