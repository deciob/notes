= CSS Grid =

== Grid container ==

All starts here, with:

{{{css
    .my-container {
      display: grid;
    }
}}}

This creates a new grid formatting context for all direct children of `.my-container`.

== Grid items ==

The direct children of the grid container.

{{{html
    <div class="my-container">
        <div>Grid item 1</div>
        <div>Grid item 2</div>
        <div>Grid item 3</div>
    </div>
}}}

== Grid lines ==

A grid layout is made of columns and rows and these are delimited by grid lines.
In a 3 column layout, we will have 5 grid lines, starting on the left of the first column in a left-to-right language.
Grid lines are numbered starting from 1.

== Grid tracks ==

A grid track is what lies between 2 grid lines, basically the column or row itself.

== Grid cells ==

Self explanatory, a grid cell exists at the intersection of two grid tracks.
If nothing else is specified, the children of the grid container will be automatically laid out on these cells.

== Grid areas ==

A collection of adjoining grid cells.

== Grid gaps ==

For styling purposes, a gap is a space you can set between grid tracks to space grid cells out.


== A grid example, with rows and columns defined ==

{{{css 
.container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 5em 100px 30%;
    grid-template-rows: 200px auto;
    gap: 10px;
}
}}}

`auto` here means: fit the content and expand the cell if space is available.

=== Intrinsic sizing keywords ===

`min-content`: make the cell as small as possible, without the content overflowing.
`max-content`: make the content fit all on one line, overflow if no space.
`fit-content()`: behave like _max-content_ until the size you pass in as an argument, after that the content starts to wrap.

=== fr unit ===

`fr` arranges the space flexibly after the lines have been drawn.
If different fr units are chosen for different tracks (`1fr`, `2fr`), then these will be flexed out proportionally.
If mixed with a fixed unit, such as `grid-template-columns: 200px 1fr`, then it will take up the remaining available space.  

=== minmax() unit ===
