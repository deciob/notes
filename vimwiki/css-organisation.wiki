= Organising CSS =



== Comments ==

Comment logical sections, such as _headers and navigation_, _main section_, _sidebar_, etc.
This will help to visually identify the different sections.
You can also add a special string in the comments, such as *||*, to more easily jump from one section to another.


== Sections ==

Add the general styling first. This is anything that is not specific to a certain logical section or component. 
If the sections become very big, break them down in separate files and consider using a compilation step to concatenate, minify, etc.


== Selectors ==

As much as possible avoid overly-specific selectors. 
Overly-specific selectors make it hard to reuse and maintain code.


== BEM ==

[[https://getbem.com/|BEM]] stands for *Block*, *Element*, *Modifier*.

=== Block ===
A *Block* is a section of your *HTML* that has meaning on its own. 
*Blocks* can be nested, but are all semantically equivalent. 

{{{html
 <div class="block">...</div>
}}}

=== Element ===
*Elements* live within *Blocks* and only make sense as part of a block. 

{{{html
 <div class="block">
    <div class="block__element"></div>
 </div>
}}}

=== Modifier ===
*Modifiers* change the appearance of a *Block* or an *Element*.

{{{html
 <div class="block">
    <div class="block__element block__element--highlighted"></div>
 </div>
}}}
