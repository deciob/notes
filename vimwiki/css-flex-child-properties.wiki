== Flex Child Properties - Flex items ==

== flex ==

`flex` is a shorthand property for `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink` and `flex-basis`.

The defauls are: 
* flex-grow: 0
* flex-shrink: 1
* flex-basis: auto

=== flex-grow ===

How much can a child grow within the flex container?
0 is no growth, so basically the child gets the size from its content.
If all children have the same amount of flex-grow, say 1, then the available space within the container will be allocated equally.

=== flex-shrink ===

How much can a child shrink within a flex container?
For example, if we set a flex-shrink of 1, we allow the browser to break a line of content across multiple lines if necessary. 

=== flex-basis ===

The default size before all the flex wizadry. The default `auto` value means pick the actual size of the element.


== flex considerations ==

Most of the time you are good using `flex: {value}`, ie only setting the `flex-grow` property. 

Setting `flex-grow: 0`, `flex-shrink: 0` and `flex-basis: {value}` means locking the size to whatever we give to `flex-basis`. In other words we are saying: no growth, no shrinking, pick your ideal size that I am setting you on flex-basis.


== align-self ==

`align-self` allows to set a default alignment on a single flex item.

== Considerations ==

There is no `justify-self` in *flexbox*, but we have it in *grid*. This is because all flex items are part of a same group, we can not individually separates them along the main-axis.
