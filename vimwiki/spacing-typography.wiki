= Spacing & Typography =

== Tips ==

Try using only two font sizes and then use spacing, font weight and color to create a hierarchy.

Try a small negative spacing between font characters, especially with headerers.

Try line height as a small multiple of the font size, 1.2-1.3, and for headerers the multiplier should be smaller.
